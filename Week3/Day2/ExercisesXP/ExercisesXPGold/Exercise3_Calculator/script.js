// Instructions
// Make a Calculator. Follow the instructions:

// 1.Prompt the user for the first number.
// 2.Store the first number in a variable called num1.

let num1 = Number(prompt("Enter the first number"));

// Hint : console.log the type of the variable num1. What should you do to convert it to a number ?
// 3.Prompt the user for the second number.
// 4.Store the second number in a variable called num2.
let num2 = Number(prompt("Enter the first number"));

// 5.Create an Alert where the value is the SUM of num1 and num2.

// 6.BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

alert(`the SUM of ${num1} and ${num2} = ${num1 + num2}/
the subtraction of ${num1} and ${num2} = ${num1 - num2}/
the multiplication of ${num1} and ${num2} = ${num1 * num2}/
the dividing  of ${num1} and ${num2} = ${num1 / num2}`);
