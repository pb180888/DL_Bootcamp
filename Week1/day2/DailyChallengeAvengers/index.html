      <p>Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard.</p>
      <div class="margin">
        He was worshiped by the humans known as Vikings and became part of Norse
        Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him
        to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the
        Ten Realms. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too
        much, Odin sent him to Midgard (more commonly known as Earth) as a
        disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake, stripped of his
        memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his
        godly powers. Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as
        one of the founding members of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
